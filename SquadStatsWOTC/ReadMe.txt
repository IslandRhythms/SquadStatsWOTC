This mod collects information about your squads and displays it in the commander's quarters.

Information about a squad is updated when that squad goes on a mission.

If a squad is deleted, their status will be set to decomissioned.

Decomissioned Squads can not be reactived.

Be sure to download the correct version of highlander depending on which dlc you have.

You can change the default squad name, which is xcom, by going into the int file and changing the name.
What the mod does is the gatecrasher team will be given that squad designation. The first time you create a squad with the default name, it will link the gatecrasher team to that squad. Once you've linked the entry, it cannot be re-linked.

The mod tracks the following:
Squad Success Rate
Success Rate against each chosen.
If the squad permanently eliminated a chosen and which one.
Deceased Members of a squad.
Former members of a squad.
Past names of the squad.
How many missions they've been on.
How many missions they've failed

When the squad was created
The average rank of the squad (seen in the select menu next to the squad icon)
The current squad leader (This is the first soldier assigned to the squad, can be changed)
Number of soldier in the squad
If the squad is active or decommissioned.

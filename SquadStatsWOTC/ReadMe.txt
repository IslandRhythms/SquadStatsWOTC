This mod collects information about your squads and displays it in the commander's quarters.

Information about a squad is updated when that squad goes on a mission.

If a squad is deleted, their status will be set to decomissioned.

Decomissioned Squads can not be reactived.

You can change the default squad name, which is xcom, by going into the int file and changing the name.
What the mod does is the gatecrasher team will be given that squad designation. The first time you create a squad with the default name, it will link the gatecrasher team to that squad. Once you've linked the entry, it cannot be re-linked.
